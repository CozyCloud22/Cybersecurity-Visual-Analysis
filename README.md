## Introduction

Cybersecurity is an ever-growing concern in today's world, with attacks on individuals, businesses, and governments becoming more frequent and more sophisticated. In this project, we analyze a dataset of cybersecurity attack counts, victim counts, country involvement, and other related information to better understand the nature of these attacks and how they can be prevented.

## Data Source

The data for this project is stored in an Excel file, which contains the following columns:

- Title
- Date
- Affiliations
- Description
- Response
- Victims
- Sponsor
- Type
- Category
- Sources_1
- Sources_2
- Sources_3

This dataset was sourced from Kaggle and prepared for analysis.

## Visualizations

The results of the data analysis were visualized using Tableau. The visualizations included:

- A packed bubble chart of the victims of the cyber attacks
- A tree map showing the sponsors of the cyber attacks
- A discrete line chart showing the number of cyber attacks from 2005 to 2020
- A horizontal bar chart of the types of the cyber attacks

These visualizations are included in the Tableau workbook "Visualizations on Cyber Operations Attacks Test" and can be seen below:

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides a visual analysis of cybersecurity attacks and their characteristics, as well as brief descriptions on the Tablea to help better understand the data. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform cybersecurity strategies and defenses to better protect individuals, businesses, and governments from cyber attacks.
